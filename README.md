# leetcode_solver
This project aims to: 
1. Solve the question on LeetCode. (Manually)
2. Summarise the general pattern for each category of questions. (Manually)
3. Build an auto-solver to generate the code automatically. (Automatically)

As github copilot can generate code automatically, I plan to build a code generator only for LeetCode. It could be a long journey, but I like something unusual. That's where my passion come from.
