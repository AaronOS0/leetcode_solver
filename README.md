# leetcode_solver
This project aims to: 
1. Solve the question on LeetCode. (Manually)
2. Summarise the general pattern for each category of questions. (Manually)
   1. Brute Force: Regardless of Time/Space complexity
   2. Design Algorithm
      1. Boundary conditions
      2. Design: data structure + algorithms(classify -> induction)
      3. Optimization: cut leafs
   3. Transform the question to a mathematical solution
3. Build an auto-solver to generate the code automatically. (Automatically)
